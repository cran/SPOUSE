Description: Summary ellipses superimposed on a scatter plot contain all bi-variate summary
            statistics for regression analysis. Furthermore, the outer ellipse flags potential
            outliers. Multiple groups can be compared in terms of centers and spreads as illustrated
            in the examples.
